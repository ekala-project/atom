  Atom: A powerful, flexible, and unopinionated module system for Nix, enhancing composability, maintainability, and efficiency through lazy purity and granular dependency management.
---

# Welcome to Atom

Atom empowers Nix developers to create modular, self-contained units of code that are easy to compose, share, and vendor. Our mission is to streamline Nix workflows and improve code organization across all project scales, from small libraries to complex NixOS configurations and large monorepos.

Key features:

- Lazy file copying to the Nix store, surpassing eager approaches like flakes
- Granular dependency management for precise control
- Flexible, unopinionated module composition
- Enhanced code sharing and vendoring with private module member semantics
- Statically analyzable, self-contained format
- Verifiable module isolation through strict boundaries

These features enable powerful tooling for dependency analysis and structure evaluation without full Nix evaluation, opening new possibilities for distributed builds, security audits, and workflow optimization. Atom achieves this while respecting users' preferred organizational approaches.

This documentation will guide you through Atom's core concepts, usage patterns, and best practices. Whether you're new to Nix or an experienced developer, Atom provides the tools to build more maintainable and scalable Nix projects.

Let's harness the full potential of Atom and revolutionize your Nix development experience.
